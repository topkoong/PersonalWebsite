        About me
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am a 26-year-old coder, movie buff, computer engineer from Bangkok, Thailand, and I am chiefly interested in technology. You will also see from my resume that I am a graduate student in the Computer Engineering program at Syracuse University. I have experience with cyber security, vulnerability assessment, infrastructure penetration testing, and server configuration review at Deloitte as an IT analyst in the cyber security department. I also am proficient in web development, using a MEAN stack, MERN stack, or ASP.NET, which is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, Angularjs2/React.js, and Node.js) or a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET Framework used to develop web applications. The followings are examples of my React URL that I build from scratch: http://strawberry-custard-81818.herokuapp.com/, https://agile-castle-91250.herokuapp.com/, and http://shielded-earth-69097.herokuapp.com/. My GitHub repo is the following: github.com/topkoong/. In addition, I held a part-time position as a systems operator during my undergraduate career at Pragma Technology Co., Ltd. While working there, I monitored networks to maintain integrity, as well as ensured security, network connectivity, and availability to specific users. Similarly, I deployed and configured servers by applying OS patches and upgrades on a regular basis, in addition to upgrading administrative tools and utilities. Furthermore, I maintained network servers such as intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and system efficiency. I believe that my focus and productivity will be a great asset to your company. I have exceptional problem-solving skills, a methodical approach, and excellent attention to detail. I perform well when faced with strict deadlines and am also an effective communicator who works well with others.
